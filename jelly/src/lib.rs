//! Jelly implements various helpers, traits, and types for actix-web that
//! enable a nicer building experience. It's not released as a framework,
//! as I don't think this works long-term - instead, clone and chisel away
//! to get what you need.

// We re-export/hoist a few things that are commonly imported.
// Less time screwing around with Cargo.toml for a framework-feel is
// ideal.
